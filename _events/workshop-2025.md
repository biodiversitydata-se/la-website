#### Description 

The ALA-LAs Technical Workshop took place from March 11 to 14, 2025, at the Royal Botanical Garden-CSIC in Madrid. This event brought together developers and managers from the Living Atlases (LAs) community to strengthen collaboration and efficiency in developments related to the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA).

The workshop was divided into two main tracks: one for developers and another for managers, focusing on establishing a long-term strategic framework and addressing short-term development challenges.

The agenda included sessions on common installation strategies, spatial data management, reuse of GBIF infrastructures, checklinkbank project, and handling of sensitive data, among other topics.

The event concluded with a social day featuring a visit to the Royal Site of San Lorenzo de El Escorial and outdoor activities.
